# Web App Driven Wireless Standalone Hardware for Robust Image Restoration and Object Detection in Hazy Conditions

### A Raspberry Pi–Powered Edge AI System

This project presents a wireless, standalone embedded vision system that performs real-time image dehazing and object detection in low-visibility environments. Built for edge deployment using a Raspberry Pi, it integrates an optimized deep learning pipeline and it runs on localhost of Raspberry Pi.

## Problem Statement

Hazy weather degrades visual clarity, impairing critical applications like:

- Surveillance  
- Smart traffic management  
- Agricultural monitoring

---

## Project Goal

Design a low-cost, wireless, and deployable edge solution that:

- Restores hazy images  
- Detects objects in real time  
- Runs completely on Edge Computing devices  
- Interfaces through a local web app over Wi-Fi
